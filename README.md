At [r/roguelikedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/) we're doing a dev-along following [The Complete Roguelike Tutorial](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python%2Blibtcod).

## Basic Info

- I'm using Java and my own  hacked-together version of [AsciiPanel](https://github.com/trystan/AsciiPanel) which uses sprites instead of ascii characters. Don't expect great code! I'm a hobbyist who learned from piecing together online tutorials.  
- The only external library I'm using is [minlog](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/minlog) by [Esoteric Software](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware), though this may change as the tutorial progresses.

## Requirements

- The only requirement to compile the code is [Java 1.8](https://www.java.com/en/download/). I will try to release runnable jars each week and a final jar with a pre-bundled JRE for players without Java.
