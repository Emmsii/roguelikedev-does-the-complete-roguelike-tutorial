At [r/roguelikedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/) we're doing a dev-along following [The Complete Roguelike Tutorial](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python%2Blibtcod).

**The dev-along is over! [Download v1.0.0 on itch.io](https://emmsii.itch.io/forest-roguelike). You can find my final write up and screenshots [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/6v8kp5/roguelikedev_does_the_complete_python_tutorial/dlyzb7p/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=roguelikedev).**

I will be posting the final release to itch.io soon.

## Basic Info

- I'm using Java and my own  hacked-together version of [AsciiPanel](https://github.com/trystan/AsciiPanel) which uses sprites instead of ascii characters. Don't expect great code! I'm a hobbyist who learned from piecing together online tutorials.
- The game engine is based off the [Ascii Panel Tutorial](https://trystans.blogspot.co.uk/2016/01/roguelike-tutorial-00-table-of-contents.html), I've build upon it fo suit my needs.
- The tileset I'm using can be found [here](https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=14166.0) and is licensed under CC BY-SA. I've made a few additions and changes.
- Play the latest release [here](https://github.com/Emmsii/roguelikedev-does-the-complete-roguelike-tutorial/releases). Note it won't be stable and will likely crash.
- The game has been tested and runs on Windows, Mac and Linux.

#### Libraries

- [minlog](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/minlog) and [Kryo](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryo) by [Esoteric Software](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware).

## Requirements to build
